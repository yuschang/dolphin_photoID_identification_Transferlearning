The Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphin (Tursiops aduncus, IPBD) is one of the key species for marine ecosystems. Photo-identification (photo-ID) remains a fundamental method for studying dolphin populations by identifying individuals based on unique features on their dorsal fins. Despite the recent developments in learning-based photo-ID algorithms, the lack of training data for these models has become the bottleneck in improving the accuracy of algorithms. This study leverages synthetic image generation and deep learning to improve photography-based IPBD identification. We generated synthetic dorsal fin images and trained a custom triplet neural network with ResNet50 to distinguish individuals. The model achieved 84.8% accuracy within the top 10-ranked positions and 72.2% in the top 5-ranked positions, demonstrating the potential of these technologies to enhance IPBD monitoring and conservation efforts.
